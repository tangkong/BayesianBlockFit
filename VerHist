Features:
    * Peak Shapes:              Gaussian, Voigt
    * Number curves per peak:   - free - 
    * Plotting:                 each peak, background sub data
    * Background Subtraction:   Polynomial

v0.1:  
-Constructed all data structures and relevant scripts.  
-Implemented plotting functionality and basic curve functions.  
-Currently only operates for data mode 1

v0.2:
-Changed peak fitting algorithm.  Populate initial guess paramters
    for each curve based on residual.  Optimize all together
    Increases number of curve_fit calls, but does seem to help fits
-Offset all data values to be positive.
-Reporting FWHM based on curve profiles
-Implemented report for literal FWHM

v0.3:
-Separated paramDict and optParams.  paramDict contains FWHM and peak
    shape info while optParams can be fed into peak functions
-Created plotting protocol for residuals.  
    all data is offset by 1 to avoid divide by zero
-Store peak bounds in data structure (BlockData)

-Thinking about future feature extraction, aim to distill all relevant 
    parameters into BlockData Structure
    * Blocks, Peak bounds, FitParams(per peak), litFWHM
    * Future: FSDP?  others?

-Place all parameters for CSV output into summary params dict (paramDict)

To implement:
mapping of nearest neighbors and First Sharp Diffraction Peak
