Features:
    * Peak Shapes:              Gaussian, Voigt
    * Number curves per peak:   - free - 
    * Plotting:                 each peak, background sub data
    * Background Subtraction:   Polynomial

v0.1:  
-Constructed all data structures and relevant scripts.  
-Implemented plotting functionality and basic curve functions.  
-Currently only operates for data mode 1

v0.2:
-Changed peak fitting algorithm.  Populate initial guess paramters
    for each curve based on residual.  Optimize all together
    Increases number of curve_fit calls, but does seem to help fits
-Offset all data values to be positive.
-Reporting FWHM based on curve profiles
-Implemented report for literal FWHM


To implement:
Error tracking.  (Covariance matrix?  Residual?)
Block visualization.  Proper overarching visualization?
Timing protocol to assess efficiency
